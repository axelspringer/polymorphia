Release Notes
=======
## 2.4.0
* ensure compatibility with JDK 11

## 2.3.5
* allow for non generic List, Map, Set within Pojos
* filter for specific type within mongo collection: return null, if super class hierarchy can't be determined

## 2.3.4
* adding example/support for searching a whole super-class tree in a general collection that stores anything (@see PolymorphicCollectionTest) 

## 2.3.3
* a slightly cleaner way to handle parameterized List/Map/Set codecs. If they fail to create, the mongo driver default gets chosen.
* unfortunately there is no easy way to figure out if the CodecRegistry could provide a codec for a given type. Eventually an exception is being thrown instead of returning just null


## 2.3.2
* minor (dirty) fix for parameterized List/Map/Set codecs. If they fail to create, the mongo driver default gets chosen.

## 2.3.1
* minor fix in SpecialFieldsMapCodec

## 2.3.0
* For standard codecs a wrapper was added to enable to use them within polymorphic structures
* when PolymorphicCodecs are registered within the chain of codecs, Polymorphia will use them when encoding polymorphic types (instead of using a reflection based codec)
* PojoCodecProvider.Builder was enriched by two methods to enable excluding classes when building the domain model
* fine tuning while identifying polymorphic types
* type hierarchy was broken if super classes are not part of the domain model but some other superclass in the class hierarchy
* adding support to register a specialized ClassResolver if neither org.springframework.spring-core or org.reflections.reflections are sufficient when resolving classes  


## 2.2.0
* mongo version > 3.5 support
* changed enum handling

## 2.1.1
* removing PojoCodecProvider.getDefaultCodecRegistry - instead, all "broken" codecs will be ignored
* ArrayCodec now encodes bytes[] with mongo native encoding


## 2.1.0
* rewrite of ArrayCodec
* all container like codecs (CollectionTypeCodec, MapTypeCodec, ArrayCodec) now support null values
* java.lang.Object can be used as type in pojos - all classes to be encoded/decoded must be registered to the PojoCodecProvider
* improved logging when no codec can be found for a field
* a DefaultCodecRegistry similar to the one the mongo driver provides can be retrieved via PojoCodecProvider.getDefaultCodecRegistry()
* SortedMap is now supported as pap-type
* if a CollectibleCodec-Proxy is being returned from the PojoCodecProvider, all interfaces of the delegating codec are exposed as well
* the new interface DelegatingCodec - CollectibleCodec-Proxies can be asked for their delegate
* when resolving Codecs for Class-types within the pojo-context, the CodecRegistry-chain will be asked. This allows for overriding codecs for Class types. 

##2.0.0
* Improved error checking while application id generation
* add support to register codecs for any arbitrary type -> de.bild.codec.TypeCodecProvider
* support for SortedSet added
* support for polymorphic codecs that do not need to be ReflectionCodecs  -> PolymorphicCodec CodecResolver.getCodec(...)
* improved null-value handling: now nulls can be encoded as nulls or nulls are not written at all -> de.bild.codec.annotations.EncodeNulls
* added annotation driven null value handling while encoding -> de.bild.codec.annotations.EncodeNullHandlingStrategy
* added annotation driven undefined value handling while decoding -> de.bild.codec.annotations.DecodeUndefinedHandlingStrategy
